# AWS Data Engineering Labs  

**⚠️ Work in Progress**  
This project is still under development and may change at any time.

### XDT AI — XavierDataTech  
Hands‑on cloud engineering for scalable analytics

This project contains a curated set of AWS data engineering labs designed to build practical, production‑ready skills across ingestion, storage, transformation, orchestration, and analytics.  
It serves as a structured learning and portfolio framework for cloud‑driven HR and Workforce Intelligence solutions.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this repository is to provide a **progressive, real‑world set of AWS data engineering exercises**, including:

- Data ingestion pipelines  
- ETL/ELT workflows  
- Lakehouse architecture  
- Serverless data processing  
- Event‑driven automation  
- Analytics integration  

Each lab is self‑contained and focuses on a specific AWS service or architectural pattern.
